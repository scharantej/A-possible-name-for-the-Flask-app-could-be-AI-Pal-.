 # Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a web application that helps users learn AI concepts. The application should provide users with interactive content and resources to help them understand the basics of AI. The application should also provide users with a way to test their knowledge and track their progress.

# Design

The application will be built using the Flask framework. The application will consist of the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application. This page will provide users with an overview of the application and links to the different sections of the application.
* `concepts.html`: This page will provide users with information on the different concepts of AI. The page will include interactive content and resources to help users understand the concepts.
* `quiz.html`: This page will provide users with a quiz to test their knowledge of AI concepts. The quiz will be multiple choice and will provide users with feedback on their answers.
* `progress.html`: This page will provide users with a way to track their progress through the application. The page will display a list of the concepts that the user has completed and the score that they received on the quiz.

The application will also have the following routes:

* `/`: The home page of the application.
* `/concepts`: The concepts page.
* `/quiz`: The quiz page.
* `/progress`: The progress page.

# Implementation

The application can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Install the Flask framework.
2. Create a new Flask application.
3. Create the HTML files for the application.
4. Create the routes for the application.
5. Test the application.
